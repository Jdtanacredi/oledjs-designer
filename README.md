# oledjs-designer
Work in progress! A browser-based design tool to accompany [oled.js](https://github.com/noopkat/oled-js).

## What does it allow you to do?
`oledjs-designer` can help you design graphics for small monochrome OLED screens. It's built for use with [oled.js](https://github.com/noopkat/oled-js), a super-rad library for drawing to OLEDs via Javascript.

 - Use a touchscreen stylus (or mouse) to draw screens
 - Export your drawing as a `.js` buffer file ready for use with `oled-js`
 
 ## What will it eventually allow you to do? (aka //TODO)
  - Erase pixels :)... maybe fill, too
  - Choose from multiple OLED resolutions
  - Upload a PNG for editing/preview
  - Upload a `.js` buffer file for editing/preview
